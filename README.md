# MATCH IT - Puzzle Game

## Overview
Welcome to MATCH IT, a puzzle game where you need to match objects by swapping them to create rows or columns of identical objects. 
The game starts with a 4x4 grid, and as you progress through levels, the grid size increases, making the game more challenging.

## How to Play
1. Run the game by executing the Python script (`MATCH_IT.py`) located in the game folder.
   - Do not run the script directly; run it from the folder to ensure proper loading of background images.

2. Click on the "PLAY!" button to start the game.

3. In each level, you'll see a grid filled with random objects (A, B, C, D, E, F).

4. Click on an object to select it, then choose a direction (up, down, left, or right) to move the selected object.

5. The goal is to create rows or columns with identical objects.

6. Keep an eye on your moves and score:
   - Moves: The number of moves you've made.
   - Score: Your current score, calculated based on the initial score minus the number of moves.
   - Level: Indicates the current level you are playing.

7. Complete levels to progress through the game. The grid size will increase, making the game more challenging.

8. Be strategic and try to maximize your score by making fewer moves.

9. The game ends when you successfully complete all levels or when your score drops below zero.

## Controls
